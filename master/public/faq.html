# How to subset samples?

There are two possibilities:

-   After starting an analysis you can use "samples" selection box to select/unselect the samples. This will not modify the parent DataSet but only the Child DataSet to be generated.![](Images/samples-parameter.png)

-   On a dataset, clicking on "edit table" brings you to the "edit screen" that lets you remove samples from the DataSet using the minus signs on the left. Subsequently do "save as child" to generat a Child DataSet with the subset of samples. Clickin on "save" will permanently modify the current DataSet.![](Images/subset-dataset.png)

# How do I know whether/which app parameters I can/should change?

-   Critical settings are marked as required in red.

-   They may be autopopulated based on previous DataSet/B-Fabric, in this case, leave as default.

-   For more routine analysis, *e.g.*, RNA seq, scRNA seq, ChIP seq, the defaults are mostly sufficient and can be considered 'best practice'.

-   But if you have an idea of some specific settings you need, don't be afraid to play around! If it's not clear where you need to put these settings, just ask us.

-   When trying different settings, don't be alarmed if the app crashes, often we have these defaults for good reason!

-   In cases where you've changed settings, you should make good use of the "Comment" text box at the top of the app parameters page, to aid later identification of multiple versions of the same app but with different settings

![Essential settings are marked in red. In this case, "paired" and "strandMode" were autopopulated, but "refBuild" is not and will therefore need selecting. Be sure to make good use of the "Comment" box at the top so you can later easily see what settings you chose.](Images/FAQ_Q2_1.png)

# Static versus Live Reports: What's the difference and which should I use?

-   The data that goes into both these reports is identical, as produced by the app you used.

-   The static report shows the main results of the analysis when performed, and is not editable/customisable in any way.

-   The interactive report shows many of the same results, but allows for customisation of figures, as well as deeper exploration of results.

-   The interactive report does not, however, allow for editing of the underlying results. One can make changes to figures, and even exclude certain groups for figures, but not change the results (e.g., p-values).

-   We intend users to first closely inspect the static report, before later moving to the interactive report.
